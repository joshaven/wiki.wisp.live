I began my ISP career in 2001 as a network administrator for a dial-up ISP. In order to meet customers needs for higher bandwidth, I designed and successfully implemented our area’s first Wireless ISP. In my early professional years, I worked as a network administrator, wireless installer, software developer, and network operations analyst. Later I moved on to technical director and business owner, which has equipped me to provide top to bottom consulting to my clients.

I began to become influential in the WISP industry in 2011 by following and contributing to multiple message boards and forums. For years I worked hard to daily provide multiple best answers to the hardest questions that I could find. This dedication resulted in an unexpected demand for consulting services both domestically and internationally, due in large part, to people running across my answers while looking for solutions.

I have continued deepening and widening my knowledge in the WISP industry by building and strengthening WISPs all around the world through consulting. My focus as a WISP consultant is “developing profitability”.
