I began my ISP career in 2001 as a network administrator for a dialup ISP. In order to meet customers needs for higher bandwidth, I designed and successfully implemented our area’s first Wireless ISP. In my early professional years, I worked as a network administrator, wireless installer, software developer, and network operations analyst. Later I moved on to technical director and business owner, which has equipped me to provide top to bottom consulting to my clients.

I began to become influential in the WISP industry in 2011 by following and contributing to multiple message boards and forums. For years I worked hard to daily provide multiple best answers to the hardest questions that I could find. This dedication resulted in an unexpected demand for consulting services both domestically and internationally, due in large part, to people running across my answers while looking for solutions.

I have continued deepening and widening my knowledge in the WISP industry by building and strengthening WISPs all around the world through consulting. My focus as a WISP consultant is “developing profitability”. The ePMP product line has helped me, more than any other product, deliver on my my promise to develop profitability for WISP’s all around the world. It is truly an honor to be recognized by Cambium as a Wireless Professional.
