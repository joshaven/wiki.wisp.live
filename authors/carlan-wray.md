# Carlan Wray
Owner of Kittitas Broadband located in central Washington State. Background in agricultural, commercial, and residential irrigation with a strong focus on electrical and design. Believe it or not, there are a lot of parallels between the two; we're just laying out sprinklers on a three to five mile grid rather than twenty to thirty feet. And things are even more interesting when you get to the hydraulic side of things. I often tell customers that I'm plumbing bits instead of water now.

Always willing to help because I believe that when there are more slices there's more pie so don't hesitate to reach out even if you're a competitor. Who knows you might be better at this than I am and I'm good with that.

If I've been a blessing to you, please consider furthering my work with a PayPal donation.
