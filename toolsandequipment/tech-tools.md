# Tech Tools
## Termination Tools
* Klein Tools VDV226-107 Compact Ratcheting Modular Crimper
* Platinum Tools 100054C Clamshell EZ-RJPRO HD Crimp Tool
> Two schools of thought on the type of ends you use. The EZ crimp camp gets their techs up to speed quickly and ensures that you can get the thicker STP cable fully inserted into the connector. On the other hand the old school group insists that it teaches craftmanship and reduces cost in the long run.
*  IDC punchdown tool from Fluke, Ideal, or Klein. They are all simular, the cheap knockoffs generally have issues with the spring tension being too little or great.
*  Flush Cutter, Lightweight or Electrician's Scissors
*  Twisted Pair Radial Stripper Lots of variaties of these from simple cheap ones that come in the package with a patch pannel to the Klein VDV110-261 with lots of variants

## Install Tools
Fiberglass Fish Rods
Fishtape (steel is generally longer but more difficult to work with and capeable of pulling significantly larger loads. Fiberglass is easier to work with and lighter but is more prone to wear and tear and shorter for the same size real)
Wall Magnet for fishing walls if that is part of your standard installation.
Cordless Drill - Preferably a compact impact driver. Significantly better battery life when driving lags.
Crimping Tool (i.e. Klien 1005) (nice if you are using NID boxes that need grounding)
Wire Strippers
Ratchetting combo wrench for antenna mounts (http://www.gearwrench.com/wrenches/ratcheting/quadboxtm)
Installer drill bit (https://vermontamerican.com/products/bell-hanger-installer-drill-bits/)
Flexible drill bit and accessories (https://www.kleintools.com/catalog/holemaking/flexible-drill-bits) These take some practice and skill, probably best to mock up a wall for new installers if this is something they need to do. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOU0XsAEMY)
